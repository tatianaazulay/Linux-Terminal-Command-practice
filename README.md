Description
1. Filter 1 column from a CSV file. Extract out the artist names from the CSV file that can be downloaded from the Spotify Charts website (https://spotifycharts.com/regional). Ensure that the artist names are unique and sorted. Retain the header as the top of the file.
2. Download a zip file from MovieLens (https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/) using the command line interface (CLI) such as curl or wget and unzip the .zip file. It would be okay to choose the smallest (recent data) dataset.
3. Preview the first 12 lines of the movies.csv file and the last 4 lines of that same csv file.
